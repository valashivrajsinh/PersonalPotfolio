            <h1>Demonstrating Eagerness and Growth :-</h1> <br>

            I'm a first-year computer engineering student with a strong passion for the field and a thirst for knowledge. <br><br> <h2>Here's what I've been up to:</h2> <br>
            <dl>
                <dt>Relevant Coursework:</dt> 
                <dd>Aced my Introduction to Programming course, exceeding the class average. In a semester-long project, I built a simple text-based adventure game using Python, solidifying my understanding of programming fundamentals. <br><br></dd>

                <dt>Early Projects:</dt> 
                <dd>To further solidify my grasp of coding concepts, I developed a basic calculator application using C++.  Additionally, I designed a logic circuit using digital logic gates in a class simulation tool, exploring the hardware side of computer engineering. <br><br></dd>

                <dt>Participation and Initiatives:</dt>
                <dd>I'm actively involved in the Computer Science Club, attending weekly workshops on web development using HTML and CSS. This has given me valuable hands-on experience with building user interfaces.  I also attended a university seminar on "The Future of Robotics" to explore potential career paths within computer engineering.  Beyond the curriculum, I completed an online course on "Introduction to Machine Learning" to gain a foundational understanding of this exciting field. <br><br></dd>

                <dt>Skills:</dt>
                <dd>I'm proficient in Python basics and currently diving into C++ syntax and object-oriented programming principles. I'm familiar with basic coding environments like IDLE and online platforms like Codecademy. My eagerness to learn extends beyond these initial steps, and I'm actively seeking opportunities to expand my skillset. <br><br></dd>

                <dt>Goals for the Future:</dt> 
                <dd>I'm particularly interested in competitive programming.  In the coming years, I aim to further develop my programming skills and delve deeper into these areas to contribute meaningfully to the field of computer engineering. <br><br></dd>
